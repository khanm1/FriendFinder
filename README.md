# FriendFinder
A compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app for single people to find their perfect match! This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

### How it works:
From the FriendFinder website, users will enter:
* Name and a link of their profile picture.
* Answer all the questions
* Each question has a assigned value, and all values are aggragated into an overall value. This overall value compared to other overall values from other profiles. Users with similar overall values will then be matched one-to-one. A pop-up window will display the name and profile picture of the match!
